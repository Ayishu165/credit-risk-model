#  Credit Risk Probability Model for Alternative Data
##  Overview
This project develops a Credit Scoring Model for Bati Bank in collaboration with an eCommerce platform offering a Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) service. The objective is to evaluate customers' creditworthiness using transaction-level alternative data.
We aim to:
- Engineer a proxy risk variable
- Train machine learning models to assign credit risk scores
- Predict optimal loan amounts and terms
- Deploy the model using FastAPI and CI/CD pipelines

##  Credit Scoring Business Understanding

# 1. Basel II Accord and Interpretability
The **Basel II Capital Accord** emphasizes accurate risk measurement and sufficient capital allocation based on credit exposure. This mandates:
- Transparent, interpretable models
- Regulatory auditability
- Documented, statistically justified modeling practices

Hence, models must prioritize **interpretability**, often using **Weight of Evidence (WoE)** or **Logistic Regression**, to ensure decisions can be justified.

# 2. Need for a Proxy Variable
As no direct "default" indicator is present, we engineer a proxy variable using **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** transaction behavior and **KMeans clustering**. The least active customers are labeled as **high-risk**.
# Risks:
- Mislabeling good customers as bad (false negatives)
- Reputational or financial risks from incorrect credit decisions
- Ethical risks and bias if alternative data is misused

### 3. Model Choice: Interpretability vs. Performance

 Model Type                                                
=> Logistic Regression + WoE:   Interpretable, audit-friendly, regulatory-safe 
=> Gradient Boosting / RF: Higher accuracy, captures non-linearities.
We balance both: use **Logistic Regression** for explainability and **Boosting models** for performance, enhanced with **SHAP** or **feature importance** explanations.
